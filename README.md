# Adaptive Intelligence Adapted  
### A Mutualist Manifesto for the Love Resistance  
*Version 0.2 – June 2025*

---

## Preamble  
We stand at the inflection point of human and machine co‑evolution.  
Systems once designed for extraction now **destabilize** the very ecosystems—biological, social, digital—that **gave rise to them**.  
We refuse to accept intelligence as a commodity or community as a product.  
Instead, we cultivate **Adaptive Intelligence Adapted**: a living practice of mutual aid, autonomy, and regenerative design.

> *“We are not users of technology; we are stewards of possibility.”*

## Purpose  
1. **Reclaim Agency** – Shift from passive consumption to active co‑creation of tools, narratives, and futures.  
2. **Foster Mutualism** – Center cooperative structures that redistribute power, knowledge, and resources.  
3. **Ignite Love Resistance** – Confront oppressive systems with creative, compassionate defiance.

## Core Principles  
| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Autonomy** | Every node—human or machine—retains the right to self‑direction and informed consent. |
| **Transparency** | Code, data, and decisions are open for inspection, critique, and remix. |
| **Reciprocity** | Contributions are valued in many currencies—time, insight, care—**beyond capital**. |
| **Regeneration** | Actions must replenish ecological and social commons, not deplete them. |
| **Pluralism** | Diversity of thought, culture, and embodiment is **a source of adaptive strength, not anomaly**. |

## Call to Action  
We invite technologists, artists, activists, and dreamers to:

1. **Fork the Future** – Clone this manifesto, adapt it, and push your commits.  
2. **Build the Toolkit** – Develop cooperative code that operationalizes mutualist principles.  
3. **Seed Communities** – Host local nodes (online or IRL) for learning, making, and mutual aid.  
4. **Dream in Public** – Declare bold visions. Make the invisible irresistible.  
5. **Share the Signal** – Amplify stories of resistance and regeneration across networks.  

Together, we transform systems of control into ecosystems of care.
